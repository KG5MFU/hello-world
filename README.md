# hello-world
Just following the directions trying to be a good gitHubber. So far all learning - buying and playing is all so far, but I have some really high hopes for my GitHub future as being one of plenty of gain with more still giving.
Professionally I am in charge of Analytical method development, quality control implementation and oversight currently as the Chief Analytical Officer of a Hydrocarbon laboratory in the Panhandle of Texas. I am a lover of the sciences and am blessed with a beautiful family having the best spouse I dont know if Ill ever actually deserve with two spectacualr children 18 months apart with a 3yrold big sister in charge of the daytime activities around this very console :) Started on this path with the intention of making my own alternative to the currently available GPS logging and tracking options for High Power Rocketry. Currently a Level 2 rocketeer with Triopoli, and recently received my FCC callsign  - KG5MFU - 
Hopefully here for more than a passing glance!
